	<b>A simple, low-resource, open-source platformer game!</b>
</p>


## Development
The game is being developed using [Godot 4.1.1 .NET](https://godotengine.org/download).

Originally it was developed using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/download),
but it was decided to switch to Godot to bring more flexibility, better performance
and a more open development environment.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute to the project, please follow the
[coding style](CODING_STYLE.md) and the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We love contributions! So, feel free to contribute to the project as
much as you want. Let's make the best platformer game ever!

> **Note**
> Please consider using C# over GDScript. GDScript is a great
> language, but it's not as powerful and performant as C#.

### Note for Windows users

that the project uses. You can do this by configuring git to use
`lf` line endings by default. You can do this by running the following
command in the terminal:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```
